        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage with CSS</li>

          <li>Inline CSS, Internal CSS, External CSS</li>

          <li>An External Style Sheet is the most common way to style a webpage with CSS.</li>

          <li>Separation of Concerns: Each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>

          <li>CSS terminology includes:  selector, property, and value.</li>

          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>

          <li>Declarations have 2 components: 1) the CSS property we want to apply 2) the value of that property.</li>

          <li>An example of a property would be color.</li>

          <li>An example of a value would be the blue.</li>

          <li>There are margins, borders, padding, and content in HTML boxes.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          
          <li>Margins are not visible on the page.</li>

          <li> An asterisk * in CSS denotes all of the properties on the page.</li>

          <li>A class attribute allows one to share a CSS rule to any element chosen by assigning a rule to the class attribute with a class selector.</li>
